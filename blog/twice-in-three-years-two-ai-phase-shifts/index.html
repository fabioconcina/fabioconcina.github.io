            <p>In late 2022, when ChatGPT came out, it caught me off-guard. I don't remember what I asked first, but I remember that feeling. I was sitting on the sofa and I was shocked. I had been working in software for years, I knew roughly how neural networks worked, and still I was not prepared for what it felt like to have a computer just... understand what I was saying. Not through commands, not through syntax. Just language.</p>

            <p>This was my first mental model adjustment.</p>

            <p>The second time was in late 2025, when I first experimented with Claude Code running Opus 4.5. It was a different kind of shock, but with a similar strength. I described what I wanted to build &mdash; a system for automating operational records during drilling activities &mdash; and the thing came back with a plan and started executing it. With no obvious errors. The steering from my side was minimal.<br>
            I worked with GitHub Copilot for years, but the "Agent" mode always felt like a distraction, I was quicker just asking questions and integrating the suggestions myself.<br>
            This time, it was quicker to make the agent do its work. Another mental model adjustment.</p>

            <p>Two moments in three years. Both times I had the same reaction: this is new, this is a phase shift.</p>

            <p>Having worked with these models for years, I knew the limitations. Models hallucinate. They are confidently wrong in ways a human would never be. And yet. This time hit different.</p>

            <p>I don't think LLMs will get us to AGI. Not in their current form. There's a real debate about whether they truly understand or just simulate understanding very well. Most AI researchers seem to agree that scaling alone won't be enough: a <a href="https://aaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AAAI-2025-PresPanel-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 AAAI survey</a> of 475 researchers found that 76% think scaling current approaches is "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to yield AGI. I believe something different is needed. A new architecture, a new paradigm, I don't know what. But LLMs are not the final thing. They are an incredible stepping stone.</p>

            <p>A stepping stone that is already changing everything. Even with the limitations, the impact on how we work is real. Things that took my team days take hours now. Unit testing / documentation creation is trivial. Prototyping is absurdly fast. The distance between having an idea and seeing it running has collapsed in a way that was not imaginable three years ago.</p>

            <p>This is exciting and terrifying at the same time. If you're a knowledge worker &mdash; and I am one &mdash; the tools that help you today will reshape what your job looks like tomorrow. I don't think this is decades away. It might be years. And most people I talk to, even in tech, don't seem to fully get it yet.</p>

            <p>Nobody knows where this goes &mdash; not the people building these systems, not the people deploying them, and definitely not the people writing posts about them on X.</p>

            <p>What I know is that twice in three years, a computer made me rethink what computers can do. I expect it will happen again. Probably sooner than I think.</p>
